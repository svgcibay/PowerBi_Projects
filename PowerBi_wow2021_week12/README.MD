This README file provides a detailed walkthrough of the Power BI Custom Sorting exercise from Workout Wednesday 2021 - Week 12. This exercise is designed to help users practice custom sorting in Power BI, enhancing their data visualization and manipulation skills.

## Objective

The objective of this exercise is to apply custom sorting to achieve a specific order of categories in a Power BI report. This involves creating custom sorting logic using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) and modifying the report visualization to reflect the desired order.



###  Understand the Current Sorting

- Create a simple visualization, such as a bar chart, representing the data you want to sort.
- Observe the default sorting applied by Power BI, typically alphabetical or numerical.



###  Create Custom Sorting Column

1. Open the "Data" view in Power BI Desktop.
2. Select the table containing your categories.
3. Go to the "Modeling" tab and click on "New Column".
4. Enter a DAX formula to create a custom sorting column. For instance:

```dax
CategorySortOrder = 
SWITCH(
    TRUE(),
    [Category] = "Electronics", 1,
    [Category] = "Furniture", 2,
    [Category] = "Clothing", 3,
    [Category] = "Food", 4,
    9999
)
```

This formula assigns a sort order to each category based on the desired sequence.

### Step 5: Apply Custom Sorting

- With the new sorting column created, go back to the "Report" view.
- Select your visualization (e.g., bar chart).
- In the "Visualizations" pane, choose the "Sort by" dropdown menu.
- Select the new column `CategorySortOrder` for sorting.

### Validate the Results

- Check your report to ensure that categories are sorted correctly.
- Validate the order against the predefined custom sequence.

## Conclusion

Congratulations on completing the Custom Sorting exercise for Workout Wednesday 2021 - Week 12! You now have enhanced skills in applying custom sorting in Power BI, which is a critical aspect of creating meaningful and insightful data visualizations.
